# App01 Todo

A simple to-do list application implemented in Python. This project provides multiple interfaces for managing to-do tasks, including a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), and a web-based interface.

## Features

- **CLI**: Manage your tasks directly from the command line.
- **GUI**: A graphical interface for users who prefer a desktop app experience.
- **Web Interface**: Access your tasks via a local web server.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in a text file (`todos.txt`), allowing for data persistence across sessions.

## File Overview

- `cli.py`: Provides a command-line interface to interact with the to-do list.
- `functions.py`: Contains helper functions for reading and writing to the to-do list file.
- `gui.py`: Implements a graphical user interface using a Python GUI library.
- `todos-01.py`: Main script for managing to-do tasks through different interfaces.
- `todos.txt`: Stores the list of to-do tasks.
- `web.py`: Runs a local web server to manage tasks via a web interface.
- `webcam.py`: Unrelated to the core to-do functionality, but can be used for webcam-related tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required libraries: Depending on the interface you choose, additional libraries may be required.
  - For the GUI, you may need `tkinter` (usually included with Python).
  - For the web interface, `Flask` might be required.

You can install Flask with:
```bash
pip install flask
```

### Running the Application

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   ```bash
   python cli.py
   ```
   This will launch the command-line interface for managing your to-do tasks.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
   Opens a windowed application where you can view, add, and manage tasks.

3. **Web Interface**
   ```bash
   python web.py
   ```
   Start the local web server and access the to-do list through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

4. **Main To-Do Application**
   ```bash
   python todos-01.py
   ```
   Runs the primary script, which may provide combined functionality or an alternative way to manage tasks.

## Customizing the To-Do File

By default, the to-do tasks are stored in `todos.txt`. You can change the file path in `functions.py` by modifying the `FILEPATH` variable.
