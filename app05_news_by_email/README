# Python Project: News Email Sender & NASA Image Viewer

This project consists of multiple Python scripts with distinct functionalities, such as fetching the latest news articles and sending them via email, and displaying NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests`
  - `smtplib` and `ssl` (for email sending)
  - `streamlit` (for displaying content in a web app)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install requests streamlit
```

## Project Structure

- **news_by_email.py**: Fetches the latest news articles for a specified topic and emails them.
- **send_mail.py**: Handles sending emails using SMTP.
- **nasa_api.py**: Downloads NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day and displays it with a title and description using Streamlit.

## Usage

### 1. Sending News via Email
1. Open `news_by_email.py` and set the `topic` variable to your desired keyword.
2. Ensure the API key for `newsapi.org` is set correctly.
3. Run the script to fetch the latest news articles on the topic and send them to the specified email address.
```bash
python news_by_email.py
```

### 2. NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day
1. Open `nasa_api.py`.
2. Ensure the API key for NASA API is set correctly.
3. Run the script to fetch and download NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.
4. Launch Streamlit to display the content.
```bash
streamlit run nasa_api.py
```

## Configuration

- **API Keys**:
  - Replace the `api_key` variables in `news_by_email.py` and `nasa_api.py` with your own keys.
- **Email Credentials**:
  - Update `username` and `password` in `send_mail.py` with your email credentials.
  
> **Security Note**: Do not hard-code sensitive information like passwords or API keys in code. Use environment variables or a configuration file.

## Example Output

### News Email
The email contains a list of articles with the title, description, and a link to read more.

### NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day
Displays the image along with a title and an explanation from NASA's APOD.
