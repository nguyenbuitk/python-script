Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Binary Tree, Recursion
Companies: Common Interview Question

Problem Statement:
------------------
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
----------
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Explanation:
Both trees have the same structure and identical node values.

    1         1
   / \       / \
  2   3     2   3

Example 2:
----------
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Explanation:
The trees do not have the same structure.

    1         1
   /         / \
  2         null 2
