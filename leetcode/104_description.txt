104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Problem Statement:
------------------
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path 
from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
----------
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3

Explanation:
The longest path from the root to the farthest leaf node contains 3 nodes.

        3
       / \
      9  20
         /  \
        15   7

Example 2:
----------
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

Explanation:
The longest path from the root to the farthest leaf node contains 2 nodes.
