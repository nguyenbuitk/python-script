Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Binary Tree, Recursion
Companies: Common Interview Question

Problem Statement:
------------------
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A binary tree is height-balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node
never differs by more than 1.

Example 1:
----------
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true

Explanation:
The tree is balanced since for every node, the height difference between
left and right subtrees is at most 1.

      9  20
         /  \
        15   7

Example 2:
----------
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Explanation:
The tree is not balanced because the left subtree has a depth of 4 while 
the right subtree has a depth of 2, making the difference greater than 1.
