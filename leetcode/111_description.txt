Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Binary Tree, Recursion
Companies: Common Interview Question

Problem Statement:
------------------
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the 
root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:
----------
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2

Explanation:
The shortest path from the root to a leaf node contains 2 nodes.

       / \
      9  20
         /  \
        15   7

Example 2:
----------
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5

Explanation:
The shortest path from the root to a leaf node contains 5 nodes.
