## Using the `find_all` Method

To retrieve data from the Parse server using the `find_all` method, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Define the Table
Specify the table from which you want to query data. Replace `YourTableName` with the actual name of your table.

```python
table_name = "YourTableName"
```

### Step 2: Create Your Query
Construct a query in the form of a dictionary. For example, to find settings with the name "UserRegistrationSetting":

```python
query = {
    "name": "UserRegistrationSetting"
}
```

### Step 3: Set Additional Options (Optional)
You can define options to sort the results or limit the number of fields returned. Below, we limit the results to one and order them by the `createdAt` field in descending order.

```python
options = {
    "limit": 1,
    "order": "-createdAt"
}
```

### Step 4: Execute the Query
Use the `find_all` method by passing the table name, query, and options. This method returns a list of records that match the query.

```python
records = find_all(table_name, query, options)
```

### Step 5: Output the Results
Iterate through the `records` and print them out.

```python
for record in records:
    print(record)
```

### Example API Call
The query you've set up will translate into the following API call to the Parse server:

```
GET /classes/YourTableName?where={"name":"UserRegistrationSetting"}&limit=1&order=-createdAt
```

Use this documentation as a guide for constructing your queries and customizing them according to your needs.

This `README.md` provides a clear, step-by-step guide on how to use the `find_all` method. It's sectioned into steps for ease of reading, and the use of code blocks helps separate the code from the explanatory text.
